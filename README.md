**Palgo** (parallel algorithms)

A header library of templated algorithms aimed at parallel running. First entry is intended to
be a [k-d tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) implementation that can run using technologies
like [tbb](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) or [SYCL](https://www.khronos.org/sycl]).

Note that this library is very much in alpha at the moment and very much in flux. Not of it is
even parallel yet. I would suggest coming back at a later time.
